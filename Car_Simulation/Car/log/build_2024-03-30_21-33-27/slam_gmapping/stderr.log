  By not providing "Findopenslam_gmapping.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "openslam_gmapping", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "openslam_gmapping"
  with any of the following names:

    openslam_gmappingConfig.cmake
    openslam_gmapping-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "openslam_gmapping" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "openslam_gmapping_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "openslam_gmapping" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
